        1. Make a number of linked list with the same amount of the nodes.(All the nodes in the Linked List
        is the nodes which are adjacent with each other)
        2. Declare the start node, the target node(The nodes are identified with initial numbers), and
        a list which will store the path nodes in order to print in the inversed way
        3. Search(Recursive):
            1. Start with the Start Node; Search all the adjacent nodes until the next node is NULL.
            2. Move to the other node which comes very next of the head node
            3. Repeats the sequence of 2 until the next node is equivalent to target node.
            4. Return the recursion after put the current node in the store list.
         4. Print the store list from the back.
